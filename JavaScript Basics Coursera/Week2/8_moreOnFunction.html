    <h1>More on Functions</h1>

    <p>
    1. that functions in JavaScript can be anonymous. <br>
    2. functions are first-class citizens in JavaScript. Which means, you can assign a function to a variable, the way you could assign a string to a variable or a number to a variable. In fact, you can use a function wherever you can use data in JavaScript, and it's one of the very powerful features of JavaScript. <br>
    3. You can actually assign a function to a variable, and that function doesn't have to have a name. It can be nameless, it can be anonymous. <br>
    </p>

        var greeting = function(){
            console.log("good morning");
        }
        greeting();

        //functions are first class citizens in JS that we were able to assign a function to a variable just as if it were data. */

        /* //-------------------------------------------------ex2
        var greeting = "Hello, Good Morning !!";

        //functions and methods in JS
        //when you have a function that belongs to an object, it's called a method.
        //everything is an object so in that sense, every function belongs to an object of one sort or another.
        //But in reality, in JavaScript all functions are methods. So the two terms really are interchangeable. 

        function printString(){

            var string = "I am hungry";
            var Ustring = string.toUpperCase();
            console.log(string);  
            console.log(Ustring);
