    <h4>The first strategy was to use some closure with name spacing to make sure that variables stay out of the global scope.</h4>

        console.log(myPs);//can access it

        //here myPs and i both variable is global, its problematic we can use 
        //IIFE - immediately invoked function expression 
*/

        //syntex : (function(){code...}())
        (function(){
            var myPs = document.querySelectorAll("p");

            for(var i=0; i <myPs.length; i++){
                myPs[i].style.color = "blue";
        }
        }());
        console.log(myPs);//can't access it 

        //This is also called namespacing because we are. Making sure that the space for the name for this variable is set to that it's within this function. So that's actually a namespacing thing.
        //Any function in JavaScript is a closure.
