        //notice the difference between the two. The onclick property is a property because it's onclick and then an equal sign in what you're assigning to it. With addEventListener. It's a method because. Because it's got parentheses, we're going to pass in a click. That's the event we're really listening for.
    
    //1
        /* var btn = document.querySelector('button');
        function ouch(){
            alert("button clicked");
        }
        btn.addEventListener('click',ouch); */

        //by using anonymous function
        var btn = document.querySelector('button');
        btn.addEventListener( 'click', function(){ alert("button clicked"); } );

    //Question
        /* 
        What is the difference between these two event handlers?
        document.getElementById('myform').onsubmit = process;
        document.getElementById('myform').addEventListener('submit', process);
        Select all that apply.


        [A] An element can listen for more than one event when attached via the addEventListener method, but can only have one event property on it at a time.
        Correct-This is an important difference between the two approaches.

        [B]onsubmit is an event property, and the addEventListener is a method.
        Correct-It is important to understand the difference between properties and methods, even though sometimes they do similar things.

        [C] The event property should be used with inline JavaScript, and the addEventListener method should be used in script tags.
        False

        [D] The event property is an older way of doing things and does not work on newer browsers.
        False

        [E] The event listener can be removed via the removeEventListener method, whereas the event property can only be removed by replacing that event property with a different one.
        Correct-This is another important difference between the two methods. */
